# Maggy 
Simple Station Networking Example

# Goal 
The goal of this super fantastic awesomeness is show how much you can do with just a little bit if code and some inspiration from wherever you can find it.

A quick note about  `JavaScript`: It is most likely not what you think. Focus less on the history of the language or what you thought you knew about it and more on the code and what it's doing. Make the decision for yourself which computer language you like best and start to love it because computers are invading our boarders in mass quantities and they are doing the jobs we don't want to do ourselves. We better start to speak a language they can understand because it is getting awefuly expensive and cost prohibitive to hire an interpreter (see [computer programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer)) and they can be found everywhere we look. Rumors have it they don't even have souls!!!


## Requirements
* Web Browser
* NodeJS
* Text Editor
* Basic understanding of right and wrong(Boolean Logic)

## Installation
Run the maggy.js using node from the folder you download and unzip to. No further switches or parameters are needed.

    node maggy.js

The console output will tell you what IP address and port that it is listening on. Point your favorite browser to that address and you will find the rest of the information you need to roll it out.


### DEBUG
Use the debugger in both nodejs and the browser to work on the project. It's all JavaScript so easy to work with.
